# CourseraDataProducts
Class project for the JHU "Creating Data Products" course hosted on Coursera

This repo contains a .Rpres HTML5 presentation as well as Shiny files to run a web application.

To demonstrate these tools, I chose to use data from the classic Kaggle 'Titanic' competition, where we try to predict passenger survival based on information such as age, sex, number of siblings / parents / children on board, fare, ticket class, cabin etc.

See the 'documentation.txt' file on how to use the application.
